# PythonCourse_UNPAZ_class3
It's in Spanish because my Python teacher had to correct it.

This code have to be used from main.py where it calls the files when you request it >int's from 1 to 15<.
The code will be shown by console.
The execises are all for the 3rd class of a Python Initiation Course from Universidad Nacional de Jose C. Paz.

This is my first Git repo!
